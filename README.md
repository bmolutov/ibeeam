# Running commands
We have created Makefile for defining aliases for django, postgres, docker, docker-compose commands

Use 'make' for performing commands. Firstly run 'make help' command to see documentation

# Extra info
We are following declarative approach using docker-compose.yml file, instead of imperative (when just manually running of commands is used).

We use .env file for holding environment variables for both services.

Our application consists of the following docker services: db, web. 

- db stands for our database (PostgreSQL of version 12.11 is used)
- web stands for our django application (Django of version 3.2.15 is used)

As you can see these services will run on different containers.

We have defined volumes for each service, there will be located files and data generated by runtime of the app.
Also these services are bound to one network with Bridge driver, which allows containers communicate with each other.
